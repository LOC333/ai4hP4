## Motion Compensated Pulse Rate Estimation
Pulse Rate Estimation Algorithm using PPG signal collected from a wearable wrist device. The [Troika](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6905737) dataset was used. A 3 axis accelerameter signal was also collected and this allowed removal of the motion component from the signal. Mean Absolute Error was calculated to provide the confidence.
